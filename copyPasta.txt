i came to school today snuggling my nezuko body pillow. my bully stopped me. "what's with that lame ass pillow" i sighed. "yare yare daze. 14." he was confused. "14?" i smurked. "that's how many times i could have killed you just now." he gave me the meanest uppercut and folded me. just when i thought i was finished, i heard nezukos voice in my head.l "get up blade! TATAKAE!" i grabbed his ankle. "we're not finished yet damn it!" he curb stomped the living shit out of me and i woke up in a hospital.

Women’s Suffrage Needs To End: It’s Unconstitutional: Women are living breathing human beings and I can’t believe I have to type this. Women don’t deserve to suffer. I can’t believe the male race actually encoded this into law. If you didn’t know it’s the 19th amendment, WHICH IS SEXIST BECAUSE ITS BEFORE THE 20TH CENTURY(the century were in rn). It’s super disrespectful for women of power and they don’t need to suffer anymore. I hate men and how it appeases to the male view. What we need is more Male suffrage. We need to actually encode males suffrage into law and remove the 19th amendment because of the obviously sexism.
As a person who plays games :video_game::joystick: and watches anime :unicorn:, it would be amazing :star_struck:to have a roommate:cowboy: who also has similar interests. :closed_book::space_invader::rugby_football:To elaborate, we could play :raised_hands::raised_hands:and sleep :zzz: on a similar schedule :calendar_spiral:if we were to game later into the night :sleeping:. Plus, a roommate with these traits would be more understanding :smiling_face_with_3_hearts: of any screenlight at night or more tolerable of any audio:mega::loudspeaker: from the game/show:skull::skull:. In particular, I am a big fan of League of Legends :magic_wand::magic_wand:and Valorant :knife::knife:, I also plan to bring a few plushies:teddy_bear: and figurines:moyai::moyai::statue_of_liberty: from these games to display in my room.
Anime is literally the best thing ever. All of you baka Americans who can't wrap your minds around it because you think your Hollywood films and TV shows you are just stupid and wrong and need to stop speaking. Literally nobody likes your opinions except the other baka Americans that don't understand Anime culture and the fact that Anime is truly a masterpiece of art, emotion and plot development. The characters always develop so well and so does the plot and it is just like really good. Like literally just watch it and you will understand you stupid white people. Ok, I am white but like I like anime so I'm basically Japanese at this point. Anyways, back to the subject, have you ever heard of the best anime ever, Redo of Healer...
I have a dream. That one day every person in this nation will control their own destiny. A nation of the truly free, dammit. A nation of action, not words, ruled by strength, not committee! Where the law changes to suit the individual, not the other way around. Where power and justice are back where they belong: in the hands of the people! Where every man is free to think - to act - for himself! Fuck all these limp-dick lawyers and chickenshit bureaucrats.
The phrase “it’s just a game” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you’ve lost twice. There’s always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.

my grandparents struggled to escape the vietnam war so i could meow and call girls mommy over the internet
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
it's supposed to snow 4 inches tomorrow so my professors are cancelling class. and i gotta say, i totally agree, 5 inches is way too much to handle, right? it just seems so unnecessary, i think that 3 inches is ideal for having a nice balance so it's not too much or too little length - sorry i mean depth, talking about snow.
people ask me why i only get a 3 inch sub from subway. and i tell them that 3 inch subs are enough. the 6 inch is way too big. i mean it could hurt me if i try to eat the six inch sub, simply because it's so big. i mean 3 inches fills me. it leaves me satisfied and happy. sometimes, i can't even finish it! maybe 3 inches... is just too much. they should add 1 1/2 inches. i feel like 1 1/2 inches will still get the job done.
the knife i got is crooked but that's okay. knives don't need to be straight to cut. knives with a little curve work just as good. actually, i think crooked knives work better. we need to stop expecting all knives to be straight and accept crooked knives in all their curvy glory. i think we should all love crooked knives.
If you were killed, I wouldn't be at your funeral… because I'd be in jail for killing the person that killed you! We are true friends we ride together/we die together. Send this to everyone you care about including me if you care. See how many times you get this! I want you to know that you are amazing and you are my friend until my death and forever. If I don't get this back, I understand. But I have a game for you, once you read this letter, you must send it to 15 people, including the person who sent it to you. If you receive at least 3 back, you are loved
can we honestly e date? you’re so beautiful. You always make me laugh, you always make me smile. You literally make me want to become a better person... I really enjoy every moment we spend together. My time has no value unless its spent with you. I tell everyone of my irls how awesome you are. Thank you for being you. Whenever you need someone to be there for you, know that i’ll always be right there by your side. I love you so much. I don’t think you ever realize how amazing you are sometimes. Life isn’t as fun when you’re not around. You are truly stunning. I want you to be my soulmate. I love the way you smile, your eyes are absolutely gorgeous. If I had a star for everytime you crossed my mind i could make the entire galaxy. Your personality is as pretty as you are and thats saying something. I love you, please date me. I am not even calling it e dating anymore because I know we will meet soon enough heart OK I ADMIT IT I LOVE YOU OK i hecking love you and it breaks my heart when i see you play with someone else or anyone commenting in your profile i just want to be your girlfriend and put a heart in my profile linking to your profile and have a walltext of you commenting cute things i want to play video games talk in discord all night and watch a movie together but you just seem so uninsterested in me it hecking kills me and i cant take it anymore i want to remove you but i care too much about you so please i’m begging you to eaither love me back or remove me and never contact me again it hurts so much to say this because i need you by my side but if you dont love me then i want you to leave because seeing your icon in my friendlist would kill me everyday of my pathetic life.
Our Jonesy, thou art in fortnite, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in the battle bus. Give us this day, our daily slurp juice, and forgive us our fortnite dances. As we forgive those who fortnite danced against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from tilted towers.
Dear madam that I am delivering this message to, I would like to formally request that you deliver to me a photograph of yourself flaunting your immaculate body with little to no fabric on it, if you do wish to decline my request that is all very well but if you wish to accept my request that would also be grand, thank you and have a nice day!
I know that a lot of people want to catch em' all, but my job is a much bigger challenge. It is my goal to masturbate to all 807 Pokemon, plain and simple. I usually try to do it twice a day, regardless of the difficulties. At the end, I always win. I go on places like Deviantart, rule 34 and, occasionally e621 in order to achieve this massive goal, and when I finally do, I will become a Pokemon Master. Sometimes, it is easy. I can come in five minutes looking at Gardevoir or Lopunny pornos. Sometimes I come across major challenges that I have to overcome, in the case of Garbodor and Magikarp especially. I have to imagine the wet, sloppy fish mouth sucking on my cock without thinking about the actual fish itself. It is very hard, but the satisfaction you get when you achieve victory is immense. Not only do you get the generally pleasurable feeling from ejaculation, but you also know that you overcame an obstacle few men have dared to try. I have a total of 347 successful ejaculations total, but it only gets harder as I move on. When I see a Serperior, for instance, I have to think to myself "In what way can I imagine this creature in order to get off to it?" It is a puzzle for sure, considering I do not have a thing for (most) of these creatures, making it extremely entertaining and interesting for others to watch. I try to focus in on its somewhat beautiful face, and think about that more than the yards of snake behind it. I sometimes have issues with Pokemon like Machamp, who appear extremely male. But I always find a way. There has been no hurdle too steep for me. I want to be the very best. Anything lower does not cut it. And that is why I am beating off to pictures of Lucario on the Internet, mom.

My name is Bella Thorne, and this is the story of  the time I found out I had dyslexia. I remember when I started first grade, right away it was awful because I couldn’t read as well as the other kids. My brain mixed my letters b and d and m and w. Dyslexia is different for EVERYONE who has it. For me, it made it harder to read or write. I started working really hard on how to read better. My family helped me by making me read everything from menus, to cereal boxes, to road signs. Today, I read a year above my grade level, and I learned to face my problems, not run away from them. Dyslexia makes things hard for me, not impossible. You just watched a TTI, on Disney Channel.
Gardevoir is literally one of the most fuckable pokemon there are, you're just mad because you're in denial. Let's start with fact now, Gardevoir is 5'3", this is not only the perfect height, but it means they can also have enough height to be able to do anything you want. While being 5'3", Gardevoir is also only 103LBs, so, theyre lite enough to pick up and have an all around good time. So, these are facts, not only this, but Gardevoir, LITERALLY, does not feel the pull of gravity, while also distorting dimensions. So, not only does this mean that Gardevoir can do anything they want ignoring gravity, but they are literally capable of making a pocket dimension in which yall can fuck in. These are all facts. Continuing with these facts, Gardevoir is telepathic and feels a strong emotion connection to their trainer, so, they will know before you that you're horny, she literally has it locked down and in the know before you're even aware of it, this only means that they are are able to serve their trainer in every way possible. So, these are just the facts on Gardevoir, but let's go even deeper so I can prove to you how Gardevoir is literally the most fuckable pokemon there is: Gardevoir can learn double team, so, now you get to fuck two of them. Gardevoir can learn charm, so, you thought you were horny before, but now it's compounded on itself. Finally, Gardevoir can learn mean look, combining this with double team, means not only do you get a tsundere on your dick, but also a submissive one. It's the best of both worlds. Gardevoir is literally the most fuckable pokemon there is and all of these are facts that yall are too afraid to realize
Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white.
